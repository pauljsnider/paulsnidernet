                    <p>Hi, I’m Phil — born and raised in Springfield, Missouri, now living in Washington, D.C. I work for the FYI (yep, the kind of place that makes people raise their eyebrows and lean in). Life here moves fast, but I’ve still got that easygoing Midwest energy and a sharp eye for good conversation.</p>
                    <p>Looking for an older female roommate who’s confident, kind, and maybe a little sassy. I appreciate someone who’s got stories to tell, wisdom to share, and doesn’t mind the occasional glass of wine or deep dive into documentaries we’ll never finish.</p>
                    <p>I’m tidy, thoughtful, and can cook more than just eggs (though my scrambled game is strong). Whether we’re just sharing rent or catching a spark, I’m open to seeing what clicks.</p>
                    <p>Let’s make home feel like the best part of the day — with a side of laughter and maybe something more.</p>
