# GitHub Pages Compatibility Test Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the findings from testing the Junior Current website for GitHub Pages compatibility as specified in task 11.4 of the implementation plan. The test focused on ensuring all links use relative paths and that the site structure is compatible with GitHub Pages hosting.

## Test Date
May 18, 2025

## Test Environment
- Local development environment
- GitHub Pages deployment

## Test Criteria
1. All HTML files use relative paths for links and resources
2. Image paths use correct case sensitivity (Images/ instead of images/)
3. Site structure is compatible with GitHub Pages

## Issues Found and Fixed

1. **Case Sensitivity in Image Paths**
   - Issue: Image paths in HTML files used lowercase "images/" while the actual directory is "Images/" with capital I
   - Fix: Updated all image paths to use correct case "Images/" in all HTML files
   - Files affected: All HTML files

2. **Page Loading Issue**
   - Issue: Page would not complete loading on GitHub Pages
   - Fix: Enhanced main.js with proper error handling and timeout mechanism
   - Files affected: js/main.js

3. **Twitter Icon Missing**
   - Issue: Twitter icon was not displaying in the footer
   - Fix: Updated Font Awesome class from "fa-x-twitter" to "fa-twitter"
   - Files affected: All HTML files

## Recommendations

1. **Maintain Case Consistency**: Always use the exact same case for directory and file names in paths
2. **Error Handling**: Ensure all JavaScript has proper error handling to prevent loading issues
3. **Testing Process**: Test on GitHub Pages environment regularly during development
4. **Image Optimization**: Continue to optimize images for faster loading on GitHub Pages
5. **CDN Usage**: Continue using CDNs for libraries like Font Awesome to improve loading performance

## Conclusion

The Junior Current website is now fully compatible with GitHub Pages hosting. All identified issues have been resolved, and the site functions correctly in the GitHub Pages environment. The website meets all requirements specified in task 11.4 of the implementation plan.
