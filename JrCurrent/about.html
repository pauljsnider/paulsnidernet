            <div class="about-content">
                <p>The Junior Current is a competitive girls soccer team based in Overland Park and Leawood, Kansas, inspired by the spirit, energy, and excellence of the KC Current. Formed by a group of passionate young athletes, dedicated families, and coaches who believe in developing both skill and character, the Junior Current is more than just a team—it's a community.</p>
                
                <p>Our players come from different schools but share one goal: to support each other, compete with integrity, and grow together through the game they love. Whether it's practice or game day, the Junior Current plays fast, plays smart, and plays as one.</p>

                    <h2>Our Journey</h2>
                    <p>The Junior Current was established in 2023 when a group of talented young players from various recreational teams decided to join forces and compete at a higher level. Drawing inspiration from the professional women's soccer team KC Current, our team adopted their colors, values, and commitment to excellence.</p>
                    
                    <p>Since our formation, we've competed in various tournaments and leagues across the Kansas City metro area, building our skills and reputation as a team that plays with heart and determination.</p>
