                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>I am an accomplished engineering executive dedicated to transforming healthcare through scalable, secure, and data-driven solutions. With 20+ years of experience in healthcare IT, I have led large, globally distributed teams of over 300 engineers, delivering mission-critical SaaS platforms for EHR, interoperability, and advanced analytics.</p>
                    
                    <p>Currently serving as Vice President of Engineering at Netsmart, I oversee cloud-native architectures, AI-driven data platforms, and high-scale interoperability frameworks that process billions of transactions monthly and support tens of thousands of healthcare organizations nationwide.</p>
                    
                    <p>Starting my career developing pharmacy products, I advanced into leadership roles spanning Pharmacy, Clinical Supply Chain, Nursing, Infection Control, Rehabilitation, and Physician workflows. My expertise lies in integrating complex healthcare ecosystems, leveraging AI and ML for meaningful insights, and championing agile practices that accelerate innovation.</p>
                    
                    <p>Prior to Netsmart, I managed global platform engineering teams at the world's largest EHR provider, driving strategies for interoperability, large-scale cloud deployments, and data-centric solutions.</p>
                    
                    <p>My passion for continuous learning, coaching, and a user-focused approach to product development drives me to create technology that truly makes healthcare more accessible, effective, and efficient for everyone.</p>
                    <p>My core belief is that technology, when strategically implemented, is the most powerful catalyst for business growth and transformation. I am passionate about not just adopting new technologies like AI and cloud-native solutions, but in deeply understanding their potential to redefine industries and create sustainable competitive advantages. My approach involves fostering a culture of continuous innovation, anticipating future trends, and building resilient, scalable technology ecosystems that are prepared for tomorrow's challenges and opportunities. As a technology leader, I aim to bridge the gap between cutting-edge capabilities and tangible business outcomes, ensuring that every technological investment drives strategic value.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">My Strategic Outlook on Technology & Innovation</h2>
            <div class="outlook-content">
                <p>We are navigating an era of unprecedented technological advancement, where artificial intelligence, data analytics, and pervasive cloud computing are not just trends, but fundamental forces reshaping entire industries. My vision for a technology leader in this dynamic landscape extends beyond mere adoption of new tools; it's about proactively architecting the future by deeply embedding technology strategy into the core of the business. This means anticipating market shifts, identifying emerging technologies that can unlock new value, and translating them into tangible strategic advantages that drive growth and differentiation.</p>
                <p>Central to this vision is the imperative to build organizations—encompassing people, processes, and platforms—that are inherently agile, resilient, and scalable. Cultivating an innovation-first mindset throughout the engineering culture is paramount, empowering teams to experiment, learn rapidly, and not only respond to change but to become its architects. This involves championing data-driven decision-making at all levels, fostering cross-functional collaboration, and creating an environment where continuous learning and adaptation are a natural rhythm of operations, ensuring the technology ecosystem can evolve with future demands.</p>
                <p>A forward-focused CTO must artfully balance the pursuit of pioneering innovation with pragmatic execution and unwavering commitment to robust governance and cybersecurity. It's about ensuring that as we harness emerging technologies to create new value streams and enhance customer experiences, we do so responsibly, with a clear understanding of potential risks and a proactive approach to mitigation. Ultimately, the goal is to lead transformative change, ensuring that technological investments deliver measurable business outcomes, foster sustainable growth, and solidify the enterprise's position as a leader in the digital age.</p>
